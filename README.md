# MrEditor97's Home Assistant Add-on's Repository

Add-ons for Home Assistant. Allowing you to extend the functionality of your Home Assistant setup, these can be installed and configured from within the Home Assistant frontend.

## Available Add-ons

## Releases

Releases are based on [Semantic Versioning][semver], and use the format
of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH``. In a nutshell, the version will be incremented
based on the following:

- ``MAJOR``: Incompatible or major changes.
- ``MINOR``: Backwards-compatible new features and enhancements.
- ``PATCH``: Backwards-compatible bugfixes and package updates.

## Support

You can open an issue here on GitHub. Note, we use a separate
GitHub repository for each add-on. Please ensure you are creating the issue
on the correct GitHub repository matching the add-on.
